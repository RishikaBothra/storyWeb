<h2> The Greedy Fox
</h2>

<p>

    One hot summer afternoon, a fox was wandering through the forest, hungry and looking for food. As he walked, he came across a grapevine laden with ripe, juicy grapes. His mouth watered at the sight, and he immediately jumped to grab them. However, the grapes were hanging high up, just out of his reach.
    
    The fox jumped again and again, trying to reach the grapes, but each time he failed. Exhausted and frustrated, the fox finally gave up. As he walked away, he muttered to himself, “Those grapes were probably sour anyway. I didn’t really want them.”
