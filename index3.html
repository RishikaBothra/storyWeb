<h2>The Diligent Ant</h2>
<p> 

    In a beautiful meadow lived an ant and a grasshopper. The ant was hardworking, spending his days gathering food and storing it for the winter. Meanwhile, the grasshopper preferred to sing and dance, enjoying the warm summer days without a care in the world.
    
    The grasshopper often mocked the ant for working so hard. “Why do you waste your time gathering food? There’s plenty to eat now!” the grasshopper would say. The ant simply replied, “I’m preparing for the winter. It’s important to plan ahead.”
    
    As summer turned into autumn and then winter, the weather grew cold, and food became scarce. The grasshopper, having spent the summer in idleness, found himself starving. He went to the ant’s house and begged for food.
    
    The ant, though compassionate, had only enough food for himself and his family. He reminded the grasshopper of his warnings and said, “You should have worked when the days were warm.”
    
    The grasshopper, realizing his mistake too late, learned the hard way the value of hard work and preparation.</p>
    
    <p>Moral: Hard work and preparation lead to success.</p>
