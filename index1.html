<h2> the kind stranger </h2>



<p>
    In a small village, there was a young boy named Raju who lived with his poor parents. Every day, he would help his parents with chores and errands, despite their limited means. One day, while returning from the market, he saw an old man struggling to carry a heavy load of groceries. Without a second thought, Raju rushed over and offered to help. The old man, grateful for the boy’s kindness, accepted his offer. 
    
    As they walked together, the old man asked Raju about his life. Raju shared his dreams of going to school and learning, but he knew his family couldn’t afford it. When they reached the old man's house, he thanked Raju and handed him an envelope, insisting he take it as a token of gratitude. 
    
    When Raju got home and opened the envelope, he found a letter inside. The letter revealed that the old man was one of the wealthiest people in the village and that he had been moved by Raju’s kindness. Enclosed was a scholarship that would cover all his education expenses.</p>

    
   <P> Moral: Kindness often brings unexpected rewards. </p>
